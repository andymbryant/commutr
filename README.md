# Commutr App

I made this app for the Thinkful Flexible Bootcamp section on Asynchronous Web Apps. It can be used to find distances from a single location using a visual interface. I've often looked for something like this when considering a new workplace or apartment, having to do a bunch of single searches via google maps to find adjacent neighborhoods, bars, etc. Instead, with commutr I can quickly click around and get a sense of driving, walking, transit, and cycling distances to local landmarks, cafes, etc.

This uses the Google Maps API (Driving Direcitons, Geocoder, Location Services, Places), as well as the Axious API. And not to mention, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Jquery.
